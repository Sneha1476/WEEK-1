# SOLAR POWER PREDICTION WEEK-1
This repository focuses on predicting solar power output using linear regression, a simple and interpretable machine learning technique. Solar energy generation is influenced by factors such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and weather conditions. By utilizing historical data, this project builds a model to estimate future solar power output, enabling better energy planning and resource management. The workflow includes data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset, feature selection to identify important variables, and model training using linear regression. The model’s performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score to ensure reliable predictions.  
The repository also includes visualizations to explore data trends, correlations, and model predictions, providing insights into the relationships between input factors and solar energy output. Built using Python and libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project is suitable for researchers, students, and data science enthusiasts. It provides a practical starting point for understanding and applying machine learning to renewable energy forecasting, making it ideal for projects focused on optimizing solar power systems or studying energy production trends.
